# RoadDetectionUNet
Built by Roshan Benefo, Leah Kreichman and Stefan Papazov


As part of a project for CIS 522, Deep Learning, my friends and I built a series of UNets to detect roads from satellite images. To run the file, install **requirements.txt**, and run main.py.

Some sample outputs of the networks are below:
